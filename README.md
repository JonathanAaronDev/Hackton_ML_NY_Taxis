### Introduction
This project was developed as part of the Rupin Academic Center's Hackathon 2023, held on May 11-12. The objective of the hackathon was to analyze taxi traffic data in New York City (NYC) and create a predictive model to estimate the number of taxis at a given time and day.

### Approach
Our team diligently explored and analyzed the provided dataset, applying machine learning techniques to develop an accurate predictive model. We specifically utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, taking into account various factors such as the pickup hour, day, month, tourist season, holiday, season, and rush hour rides.

### Results
The model performed impressively on both training and test datasets, achieving a training score of 0.964 and a test score of 0.926. However, the most remarkable result came from the external test, where the model achieved an exceptional R-squared score of 0.941.

To assess the model's performance, we have prepared a CSV file that includes the actual count of taxis, the predicted count, and a score indicating the difference between the actual and predicted counts for each data point. You can find the file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQTOVI7AKdUZ3GX_qF2Tt3xevJQz9Wwn/view?usp=sharing).

### Conclusion
We are excited to present the results of our hard work during the hackathon. The predictive model we developed demonstrates its efficacy in estimating the number of taxis in NYC based on various factors. The results obtained indicate the potential value of this model in optimizing resource allocation and enhancing operational efficiency.
